Hello. I can help with web and mobile development, maintenance, enhancement, and troubleshooting. I introduce myself as an autonomous developer. I have been programming different things for more than 10 years. Main my stream is “JavaScript everywhere”, so main my technology is NodeJS. I can be both a front-end and back-end developer.
- JavaScript, TypeScripts, ECMAScript
- React, Angular
- ExpressJS, NestJS, MeteorJS, NextJS
- Mongo, MySQL, PostgresSQL

I worked a lot with PHP: Drupal, and Laravel.

I also can develop hybrid mobile applications by IONIC, and make different platform integrations.
